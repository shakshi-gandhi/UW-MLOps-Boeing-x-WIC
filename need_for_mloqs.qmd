A Simple Real-World Example: NYC Taxi Fare & Trip Time Prediction

Imagine you are building a system that predicts:

- trip duration
- fare amount

for NYC taxi rides.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You train a machine learning model using historical NYC taxi data:

- pickup and drop-off locations
- time of day
- day of week
- distance
- past traffic patterns

In a notebook, the model performs well and predicts trip time accurately. So far, everything looks great.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What Goes Wrong in the Real World?

Once the model is deployed:

- traffic patterns change
- road construction begins
- weather impacts commute times
- ride demand shifts across neighborhoods

After a few weeks, predictions slowly become inaccurate.

` The model didn’t fail. The environment changed. `

Without noticing, users start seeing:

- incorrect ETAs
- inconsistent fares
- unreliable estimates during peak hours

This is a real production problem.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What Is Machine Learning (ML)?

Machine Learning focuses on:

- learning patterns from historical data
- building models that predict outcomes
- optimizing accuracy of these models

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this example:

ML learns how trip features affect duration and cost

ML answers the question:
“How do we build a predictive model?”

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What Is Operations (Ops)?

Operations focuses on:

- deploying systems reliably
- keeping services running
- monitoring performance
- handling failures and updates

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this example:

- Ops ensures predictions are fast
- the service is always available
- failures don’t impact users

Ops answers the question:
“How do we run this system every day?”

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why ML Alone Is Not Enough

A trained model is only useful if:

- it runs reliably in production
- it stays accurate over time
- failures are detected quickly
- updates can be made safely

Without MLOps:

- accuracy drops silently
- no one knows when data changes
- retraining is manual and risky
- results are hard to reproduce

This is where ML systems break in practice.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What Is MLOps?

>> MLOps = ML + Ops

MLOps ensures that:

- models can be deployed as production services
- data and models are versioned
- model performance is monitored
- data drift and model drift are detected
- retraining and redeployment are automated

MLOps answers the question:
“How do we keep ML systems reliable in the real world?”

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How MLOps Works for the NYC Taxi Example

- Data Ingestion
- Continuously collect new taxi trip data
- Validate schema and data quality
- Training Pipelines
- Retrain models as traffic patterns change
- Track experiments and parameters
- Versioning
- Version datasets, features, and models
- Enable rollback to previous versions
- Deployment
- Serve the model via an API
- Use containers to ensure consistency
- Monitoring
- Track prediction accuracy
- Detect data drift (new routes, new traffic behavior)
- Monitor latency and failures
- Automation
- Trigger retraining when performance drops

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why We Are Doing This?

In real companies, success is not about building one good model. It is about building systems that continue to work when
data changes, usage scales, business needs evolve

This lab focuses on: production-grade ML workflows, real-world failure, end-to-end MLOps thinking

By the end, you will understand how ML systems are built, deployed, monitored, and maintained in production—using the NYC Taxi problem as an example.
