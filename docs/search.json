    "section": "Implementing",
    "text": "Implementing\n\nImport pyparsing using import pyparsing as pp, and use that for all pyparsing references.\n\nIf referencing names from pyparsing.common, follow the pyparsing import with “ppc = pp.common” and use ppc as the namespace to access pyparsing.common.\nIf referencing names from pyparsing.unicode, follow the pyparsing import with “ppu = pp.unicode” and use ppu as the namespace to access pyparsing.unicode.\n\nWhen writing parsers that contain recursive elements (using Forward() or infix_notation()), immediately enable packrat parsing for performance: pp.ParserElement.enable_packrat() (call this right after importing pyparsing). See https://pyparsing-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/HowToUsePyparsing.html.\n\nFor recursive grammars, define placeholders with pp.Forward() and assign later using the &lt;&lt;= operator; give Forwards meaningful names with set_name() to improve errors.\n\nUse PEP8 method and argument names in the pyparsing API (parse_string, not parseString).\nDo not include expressions for matching whitespace in the grammar. Pyparsing skips whitespace by default.\nFor line-oriented grammars where newlines are significant, set skippable whitespace to just spaces/tabs early: pp.ParserElement.set_default_whitespace_chars(\" \\t\"), and define NL = pp.LineEnd().suppress() to handle line ends explicitly.\nPrefer operator forms for readability: use +, |, ^, ~, etc., instead of explicit And/MatchFirst/Or/Not classes (see Usage notes in https://pyparsing-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/HowToUsePyparsing.html).\nUse set_name() on all major grammar elements to support railroad diagramming and better error/debug output.\nThe grammar should be independently testable, without pulling in separate modules for data structures, evaluation, or command execution.\nUse results names for robust access to parsed data fields; results names should be valid Python identifiers to support attribute-style access on returned ParseResults.\n\nResults names should take the place of numeric indexing into parsed results in most places.\nDefine results names using call format not set_results_name(), example: full_name = Word(alphas)(\"first_name\") + Word(alphas)(\"last_name\")\nIf adding results name to an expression that is contains one more sub-expressions with results names, the expression must be inclused in a Group.\n\nPrefer Keyword over Literal for reserved words to avoid partial matches (e.g., Keyword(\"for\") will not match the leading “for” in “format”).\n\nUse pp.CaselessKeyword/pp.CaselessLiteral when keywords should match regardless of case.\n\nWhen the full input must be consumed, call parse_string with parse_all=True.\nIf the grammar must handle comments, define an expression for them and use the ignore() method to skip them.\n\nPrefer built-ins like pp.cpp_style_comment and pp.python_style_comment for common comment syntaxes.\n\nUse pyparsing Group to organize sub-expressions. Groups are also important for preserving results names when a sub-expression is used in a OneOrMore or ZeroOrMore expression.\nSuppress punctuation tokens to keep results clean; a convenient pattern is LBRACK, RBRACK, LBRACE, RBRACE, COLON = pp.Suppress.using_each(\"[]{}:\").\nFor comma-separated sequences, prefer pp.DelimitedList(...); wrap with pp.Optional(...) to allow empty lists or objects where appropriate.\nFor helper sub-expressions used only to build larger expressions, consider set_name(None) to keep result dumps uncluttered.\nUse pyparsing Each() to define a list of elements that may occur in any order.\n\nThe ‘&’ operator is the operator form of Each and is often more readable when combining order-independent parts.\n\nUse parse actions to do parse-time conversion of data from strings to useful data types.\n\nUse objects defined in pyparsing.common for common types like integer, real — these already have their conversion parse actions defined.\nFor quoted strings, use pp.dbl_quoted_string().set_parse_action(pp.remove_quotes) to unquote automatically.\nMap reserved words to Python constants per this example for parsing “true” to auto-convert to a Python True: pp.Keyword(\"true\").set_parse_action(pp.replace_with(True)) (and similarly for false/null/etc.).\nWhen you want native Python containers from the parse, use pp.Group(..., aslist=True) for lists and pp.Dict(..., asdict=True) for dict-like data.\n\nUse “using_each” with a list of keywords to define keyword constants, instead of separate assignments.\nChoose the appropriate matching method:\n\nparse_string() parses from the start\nsearch_string() searches anywhere in the text\nscan_string() yields all matches with positions\ntransform_string() is a convenience wrapper around scan_string to apply filters or transforms defined in parse actions, to perform batch transforms or conversions of expressions within a larger body of text\n\nFor line suffixes or directives, combine lookahead and slicing helpers: pp.FollowedBy(...) with pp.rest_of_line; when reusing a base expression with a different parse action, call .copy() before applying the new action to avoid side effects.\nWhen defining a parser to be used in a REPL:\n\nadd pyparsing Tag() elements of the form Tag(\"command\", &lt;command-name&gt;) to each command definition to support model construction from parsed commands.\ndefine model classes using dataclasses, and use the “command” attribute in the parsed results to identify which model class to create. The model classes can then be used to construct the model from the ParseResults returned by parse_string(). Define the models in a separate parser_models.py file.\n\nIf defining the grammar as part of a Parser class, only the finished grammar needs to be implemented as an instance variable.\nParseResults support “in” testing for results names. Use “in” tests for the existence of results names, not hasattr().\nAvoid left recursion where possible. If you must support left-recursive grammars, enable it with pp.ParserElement.enable_left_recursion() and do not enable packrat at the same time (these modes are incompatible).\nUse pp.SkipTo as a skipping expression to skip over arbitrary content.\n\nFor example, pp.SkipTo(pp.LineEnd()) will skip over all content until the end of the line; add a stop_on argument to SkipTo to stop skipping when a particular string is matched.\nUse ... in place of simple SkipTo(expression)"
